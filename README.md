<br>
Nerf This! is an early-development third-person combat game that combines real-time action with deckbuilding strategy in a roguelike dungeon format.<br><br>
Each run drops you into a shifting dungeon filled with hostile encounters, random rewards, and meaningful choices. Cards define your abilities, modify your attacks, and unlock powerful synergies, letting your playstyle evolve with every decision.<br><br>

The design challenge is making real-time combat and turn-adjacent card logic feel like a single unified system rather than two separate games bolted together.

## Core Systems: 

### 1. Card System
<img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1hZ2UvNDUyOTY0Mi8yNjk5NzgzOC5wbmc=/original/is5eSH.png" width="100%"/>
Cards are the primary expression of player agency , they modify, extend, and reshape combat behavior at runtime.

**Card Data Model:**

Each card is defined by a `UCardDataAsset` with a type tag, effect list, cost, rarity, and upgrade path:

| Card Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Attack** | Deals damage; may apply status effects or trigger combo conditions |
| **Skill** | Non-damaging effect , reposition, buff, draw, resource generation |
| **Power** | Persistent passive; applies an ongoing modifier to combat rules |
| **Modifier** | Attaches to another card; alters its behavior when played together |

**Deck & Hand Management:**
- Player deck stored as `TArray<UCardDataAsset*>` on `UDeckComponent`.
- Draw and discard piles managed separately; shuffle triggered on draw pile exhaustion via `FRandomStream` seeded per-room.
- Hand size, draw count, and play limit are base stats modifiable by Power cards and run relics.

**Card Play Resolution:**
- Played card dispatches a `FCardEffectContext` struct to `UCardResolverComponent`.
- Resolver evaluates target, checks combo conditions, applies effects in declaration order, then fires `OnCardResolved` delegate consumed by combat and status systems.
- Combo detection: cards tag themselves with `FGameplayTag` combo markers; resolver checks active tags against incoming card's combo requirements before resolution.

```cpp
void UCardResolverComponent::PlayCard(UCardDataAsset* Card, AActor* Target)
{
    FCardEffectContext Context;
    Context.Source = CharacterOwner;
    Context.Target = Target;
    Context.ActiveComboTags = ActiveComboTags;

    for (UCardEffect* Effect : Card->Effects)
    {
        Effect->Resolve(Context);
    }

    ActiveComboTags.AppendTags(Card->GrantedComboTags);
    OnCardResolved.Broadcast(Card, Context);
}
```

**Card Upgrades:**
- Each card has one or more upgrade paths defined in its data asset.
- Upgrades are applied at rest sites or via specific reward events , `UCardUpgradeComponent` swaps the base asset reference and broadcasts `OnDeckChanged`.

---

### 2. Combat System

Real-time third-person combat runs in parallel with the card layer. Physical actions (movement, dodge, basic attack) are always available; cards extend and modify what those actions do.

**Base Combat:**
- Light and heavy attack chains authored as ordered `TArray<UAnimMontage*>` per weapon type.
- Input buffering within a configurable frame window queues next combo step.
- Chain advancement is event-driven via `AnimNotify_ComboWindow` / `AnimNotify_ComboEnd`.

**Card-Combat Integration:**
- Active Power cards can inject additional hit effects, change damage type, add status procs, or alter animation montage selection at combo decision points.
- Attack cards trigger as discrete ability activations layered on top of the base combo , they do not interrupt the physical chain.

**Stagger System:**
- `FStaggerState` struct on each actor tracks `CurrentStagger` against `MaxStagger`.
- Hits accumulate stagger; threshold breach triggers stagger animation and brief control interruption.
- Cards can modify stagger dealt, stagger resistance, or trigger effects on stagger break.

```cpp
void UCombatComponent::ApplyStagger(float Amount)
{
    StaggerState.CurrentStagger += Amount;
    if (StaggerState.CurrentStagger >= StaggerState.MaxStagger)
    {
        TriggerStaggerAnimation();
        StaggerState.CurrentStagger = 0.f;
        OnStaggerBreak.Broadcast();
    }
}
```

**Status Effects:**
- Effects (Burn, Bleed, Weaken, Shield, etc.) implemented as `UStatusEffectBase` subclasses with stack count and tick behavior.
- `UStatusEffectComponent` owns the active effect map; tick resolution fires per-effect on a shared timer rather than per-actor per-frame.
- Cards reference status effects by `FGameplayTag`; binding is resolved at runtime against the effect registry.

---

### 3. Dungeon Generation

Each run generates a dungeon layout from a seeded graph system.

- Run initialized with `int32 RunSeed` at `GameMode::BeginPlay`.
- Room graph generated as a directed acyclic graph , branching paths, merge nodes, and a guaranteed boss terminal.
- Each node is typed (`ECombatRoom`, `EEliteRoom`, `ERestSite`, `EShop`, `ETreasure`, `EBoss`) weighted by depth and prior run history.
- Room interiors , enemy composition, obstacle layout, reward tier , seeded from `RunSeed + RoomIndex` via `FRandomStream`.
- Player sees the graph as a navigable map UI; path choices are locked after the current room is entered.

```cpp
void UDungeonGraphGen::GenerateGraph(int32 Seed)
{
    FRandomStream Stream(Seed);
    TArray<FDungeonNode> Nodes;

    for (int32 Depth = 0; Depth < MaxDepth; ++Depth)
    {
        int32 Width = Stream.RandRange(MinWidth, MaxWidth);
        for (int32 i = 0; i < Width; ++i)
        {
            FDungeonNode Node;
            Node.Type = SelectRoomType(Depth, Stream);
            Node.Seed = Stream.GetCurrentSeed();
            Nodes.Add(Node);
        }
    }

    ConnectNodes(Nodes, Stream);
}
```

### 4. Reward System

Rewards are offered between rooms and after elite/boss encounters.

- **Card Offers**: 3 cards drawn from a weighted pool filtered by current deck tags and run depth. Player picks one; others are discarded.
- **Relics**: Persistent passive items that modify run-wide rules. Defined as `URelicDataAsset` with trigger hooks into the event bus.
- **Shop**: Appears at designated map nodes , offers cards, relics, and consumables for gold. Gold drops from elite encounters and treasure rooms.
- **Rest Site**: Player chooses between healing HP or upgrading one card in deck.

Offer pools are built from `UDataTable` rows weighted by rarity and filtered via `FGameplayTagQuery` against current deck composition , decks already heavy in a tag see reduced offers of that type to encourage build diversity.

---

### 5. Enemy AI

Enemies use Unreal's Behavior Tree system extended with custom `UBTTask` and `UBTDecorator` nodes in C++.

- Each enemy archetype (`AEnemyCharacter` subclass) has a distinct BT asset defining attack patterns, positioning logic, and retreat thresholds.
- **Intent System**: enemies telegraph their next action one beat before execution , intent icon displayed above enemy head, giving card-play decisions a reactive dimension.
- Intent is resolved by the BT and broadcast via `OnIntentChanged` delegate consumed by the HUD.
- Elite enemies have phase transitions: health threshold triggers `OnPhaseChange` delegate, injecting a new BT subtree with an expanded move set.

---

### 6. Run State & Meta Progression

**Per-Run State:**
- `URunStateComponent` on `GameMode` tracks current HP, gold, deck, relics, dungeon seed, and room history for the active run.
- On run end (death or boss clear), run data is summarized and written to the meta save.

**Meta Progression:**
- Persistent unlocks (new card pool entries, starting relic options, character variants) stored in `UMetaSaveGame`.
- Unlocks gated behind run achievements , first clear of depth X, building a specific tag combination, etc.
- Meta save is separate from run state; run save is discarded on death (roguelike permadeath enforced at save layer).

---

### 7. Save System

- Active run serialized via `USaveGame` subclass on room transition , not mid-room.
- Saved data: run seed, room index, player HP/gold, deck state (card list + upgrade flags), active relics, status effects, map graph with traversal state.
- Async write via `UGameplayStatics::AsyncSaveGameToSlot` to avoid hitch on room load.
- On game launch, presence of a run save triggers resume prompt; on death the slot is cleared before returning to menu.

## Performance Targets & Optimization

| Target | Approach |
|---|---|
| 60 fps (PC, 1080p+) | LOD chains on all meshes; Nanite for static geo; draw call budgeting |
| Room streaming | Rooms loaded async via `TSoftObjectPtr`; previous room unloaded on transition |
| Tick optimization | Status effect ticks batched on shared timer; idle actors disable tick |
| AI | BT paused for off-screen enemies; perception system range-gated |
| Card UI | Hand widget pooled , card actors reused across draw cycles rather than respawned |
